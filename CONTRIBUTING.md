This project contains the demo code used at Maker faire berlin 2016.
This is intended to be used as a starting point if anyone wants to reproduce the demo.
If you find any bug that prevents the code to work you are welcome to make an issue,
however the main intent of this repos is to be cloned to serve as a base for new demos.
